# SO_Project-IST
Operating Systems Project (Y2 S1)

Both project are focused on developing an event managements system.

The first project aims to read the content of all files in a given folder and run its commands in the most optimized and parallellized way possible by putting each file into a different child process, 
and for each process running each line of the file in a different thread with a maximum set of available threads being defined. 

The second one aims to develop an server-client API with named pipes and signals to communicate and the possibility of having multiple clients, each being its own process.
