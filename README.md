# SO_Project-IST
Operating Systems Project (Y2 S1)

This project was made in two separate deliveries.

Both deliveries are focused on developing an event managements system.

The first delivery aims to read the content of all files in a given folder and run its commands in the most optimized and parallelized way possible by putting each file into a different child process, 
and for each process running each line of the file in a different thread with a maximum set of available threads being defined. 

The second one aims to develop a server-client API with named pipes and signals to communicate and the possibility of having multiple clients, each being its own process.
